						<h1>Profile</h1>
					</header>
					<p> 
						Arun is a social data scientist working towards improving urgent social problems through data and
						social insights. Currently, he is a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.demographicscience.ox.ac.uk">Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science, University of Oxford</a>  
						and a <a href = "https://www.dssgfellowship.org">Data Science for Social Good Fellow at Carnegie Mellon University</a>. He is also affiliated with <a href ="https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk">Nuffield College</a> as a Non-Stipendiary Research Fellow. 
						Arun received his PhD at the University of Oxford in 2021. In 2020 and 2021, he was based at Harvard University's Department of Sociology as a Visiting Fellow.
					</p>
					<p>
						In his work, Arun draws on powerful computational methods and innovative data sources to study some of the world's most pressing
						social problems. His research contributions span from studying the consequences of anti-refugee violence and mass
						shootings, to examining protest participation from Twitter data, to mapping displacement during the invasion of Ukraine, and exploring the social consequences of the COVID-19
						pandemic. To study these phenomena, Arun draws on a diverse set of data sources, combining web-scraped and textual data
						with digital trace, geo-spatial, and large administrative datasets.		
					</p>
					<p>
						Arun's research has been cited in over 200 news stories, including in outlets such as the New York Times, the Economist, 
						ARTE, Der Spiegel, Al Jazeera, the BBC, and the Financial Times, and has invited hearings at the European Commission, World Bank, UK House of Commons, and Dutch Government.
						His research on the impact of COVID-19 on learning loss and inequality was recently awarded with the 2021 <a href="https://www.pnas.org/about/cozzarelli-prize">National Academy of Sciences Cozzarelli Prize</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Outside his research, Arun works with local governments in the United States to minimize entry into homelessness
						through predictive analytics
						and machine learning.
