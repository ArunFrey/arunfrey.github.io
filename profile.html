						Hello! My name is Arun Frey.
						I'm a data scientist and sociologist.
					</p>
					<p>
						Currently, I am a data scientist at <a href="https://reglab.stanford.edu/">The Regulation, Evaluation, and Governance Lab (RegLab)</a> at Stanford University, 
						working on machine learning solutions that optimise government processes.
						Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the 
						<a href="https://www.demographicscience.ox.ac.uk">Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science</a>,
						University of Oxford and a research fellow at <a href="https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk">Nuffield College</a>.
						I received my PhD in Sociology at the University of Oxford in 2021 and was based at Harvard University's Department of Sociology as a Visiting Fellow between 2020 and 2021.
						In 2022, I participated in the <a href="https://www.dssgfellowship.org">Data Science for Social Good Fellowship</a> at Carnegie Mellon University.
					</p>
					<p> 
						My academic research uses granular data to understand the relationship between technology, migration, inequality, and conflict. 
						I have published articles on the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcaa007">causes of anti-refugee violence</a>, 
						the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231211054636">consequences of mass shootings</a>, 
						on using <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0259972">Twitter to study protest participation</a>, 
						and on the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2022376118">educational ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic</a>.
						What unites these projects is a common ambition to use computational methods and innovative (and sometimes strange) data
						to study pressing social problems. 
						Methodologically, I am interested in causal inference, computational sociology, and applying machine learning in the social sciences.  
					</p>
					<p>
						My academic writing has been published in <i>PNAS</i>, <i>Social Forces</i>, <i>European Sociological Review</i>, <i>Population and Development Review</i>, <i>PLOS ONE</i>, and <i>Socius</i>
						and has been cited in outlets such as the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>The Economist</i>, the <i>BBC</i>, and the <i> Financial Times</i>.
						My research on the impact of COVID-19 on learning loss and inequality initiated parliamentary discussions at the 
						European Commission, World Bank, UK House of Commons, and Dutch Government
						and was recently awarded with the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/about/cozzarelli-prize"> 2021 National Academy of Sciences Cozzarelli Prize</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some of the <a href="projects.html">academic projects</a> that I am currently working on include 
						estimating inequalities in healthcare use during COVID-19 using medical claims and registry data, 
						using real-estate listings to map local opposition to refugee settlements,
						and building a dashboard that visualises the state of anti-refugee crimes in Germany. 
						I am also working on some other, non-academic projects. Check my <a href="https://github.com/arunfrey">GitHub</a> to see what I'm currently working on
						or <a href="mailto:arun.frey@law.stanford.edu">shoot me an e-mail</a>.
