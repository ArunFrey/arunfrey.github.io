                            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to severe reductions in non-COVID related healthcare use. 
                                This study investigates whether the reduction in administered care disproportionately 
                                affected marginalised population groups. 
                                Using detailed medical claims data from the Dutch universal health care system that covers all residents in The Netherlands, we predict expected healthcare use based on 
                                pre-pandemic trends and compare these expectations with observed healthcare use in 2020.
                                Our findings reveal a substantial 10% decline in the number of treated patients in 2020 relative to prior years.
                                Declines more pronounced for individuals below the poverty line, females, the elderly, and foreign-born individuals.
                                These inequalities stem predominantly from declines in middle and low urgency procedures, and indicate that the pandemic 
                                has not only had an unequal toll in terms of the direct health burden of the pandemic, but has also had a differential impact on the use of non-COVID healthcare.

                            <p>We are partnering with Allegheny County Department of Human Services to better allocate rental assistance to
                            high risk individuals in order to keep them from falling into homelessness. Our project consists of
                            two interconnected goals: (1) to more efficiently allocate rental assistance by prioritizing those at highest risk of entering
                            into homelessness, and (2) to do so in a manner that is equitable. 
                            Our model is trained on rich historical data and predicts whether an individual 
                            who is currently facing an eviction is at risk of falling into homelessness in the near future, 
                            to prioritise them for rental assistance.
                            Initial comparisons suggest that this system constitutes a considerable improvement on the county's current decision-making process, ensuring both a more efficient and an equitable resource allocation.
                            The efficacy of this system is currently being tested in a field trial.

                            <p>In times of crisis, real-time data mapping population displacements are invaluable for targeted humanitarian response. 
                                The Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, forcibly displaced millions of people from their homes 
                                including nearly 6 million refugees flowing across the border in just a few weeks, 
                                but information was scarce regarding displaced and vulnerable populations who remained inside Ukraine. 
                                We leveraged social media data from Facebook's advertising platform in combination with pre-conflict population data 
                                to build a real-time monitoring system to estimate subnational population sizes every day disaggregated by age and sex. 
                                Using this approach, we estimated that 5.3 million people had been internally displaced away from their baseline administrative region
                                in the first three weeks after the start of the conflict. 
                                Results revealed four distinct displacement patterns: large-scale evacuations, refugee staging areas, internal areas of refuge, and irregular dynamics.

                            <p>School closures have been a common tool in the battle against COVID-19. Yet, their costs
                                and benefits remain
                                insufficiently known. We use a natural experiment that occurred as national examinations
                                in The Netherlands took place
                                before and after lockdown to evaluate the impact of school closures on students’
                                learning. The Netherlands is
                                interesting as a “best-case” scenario, with a short lockdown, equitable school funding,
                                and world-leading rates of
                                broadband access. Despite favorable conditions, we find that students made little or no
                                progress while learning from
                                home. Learning loss was most pronounced among students from disadvantaged homes.</p>

                                between 1987 and 2018 to examine whether exposure to a mass shooting sways public
                                opinion on gun legislation. The
                                results reveal that mass shootings increase support for stricter gun permits among
                                Democrats but not for individuals of
                                other political orientations. An exception to this finding occurs with school shootings,
                                which mobilize broad support
                                for firearm legislation among both Democrats and Republicans.</p>

                            <p>Who goes to protests? To answer this question, existing research has relied either on
                                retrospective surveys of
                                populations or in-protest surveys of participants. Both techniques are prohibitively
                                costly and face logistical and
                                methodological constraints. In this article, we investigate the possibility of surveying
                                protests using Twitter. We
                                propose two techniques for sampling protestors on the ground from digital traces and
                                estimate the demographic and
                                ideological composition of ten protestor crowds using multidimensional scaling and
                                machine-learning techniques. We test
                                the accuracy of our estimates by comparing to two in-protest surveys from the 2017
                                Women’s March in Washington, D.C.
                                Results show that our Twitter sampling techniques are superior to hashtag sampling
                                alone. They also approximate the
                                ideology and gender distributions derived from on-the-ground surveys, albeit with some
                                bias, but fail to retrieve
                                accurate age group estimates. We conclude that online samples are yet unable to provide
                                reliable representative samples
                                of offline protest.</p>

                            <p>There is growing academic interest in examining how terrorist attacks shape the
                                majority’s attitudes towards minority
                                groups. Yet, little is known of how these minority groups react to the backlash such
                                events provoke. This paper
                                leverages the exogenous occurrence of a series of terrorist attacks during the fieldwork
                                period of two surveys to
                                estimate how such events affect the sentiment of both citizens and asylum seekers in
                                Germany. Results of the natural
                                experiment reveal that the 2016 terror attacks in Nice, Würzburg, and Ansbach
                                substantially increased anti-refugee
                                sentiment among German respondents. In line with this increase in hostility, refugees
                                experienced more discrimination,
                                felt less welcome in Germany, and suffered clinically relevant declines in mental health
                                in the aftermath of the
                                attacks. These results provide a more holistic understanding of how terrorism corrodes
                                intergroup relations and how it
                                affects those that are blamed for the events and thus suffer the brunt of the backlash
                                following their occurrence.</p>

                            <p>In this article, I study the role that threatening events play in shaping both the
                                occurrence
                                and the distribution of
                                intergroup conflict. Using the case of anti-refugee attacks in Germany, the study finds
                                that
                                the 2015 New Year’s Eve
                                (NYE) sexual assaults led to a dramatic surge in the daily rate of violence, far
                                surpassing
                                the more short-lived effect
                                of domestic and European terrorist attacks. Importantly, this effect was more pronounced
                                among districts with low prior
                                levels of anti-refugee hostility and far-right support. The NYE event both increased the
                                frequency and changed the
                                distribution of subsequent attacks—mobilizing new, previously peaceful communities to
                                behave

                                refugee populations. Together, these findings reveal that threatening events not only
                                affect
                                the amount of intergroup
                                conflict, but may also alter the structural conditions under which such conflict emerges
