                            <p>School closures have been a common tool in the battle against COVID-19. Yet, their costs
                                and benefits remain
                                insufficiently known. We use a natural experiment that occurred as national examinations
                                in The Netherlands took place
                                before and after lockdown to evaluate the impact of school closures on students’
                                learning. The Netherlands is
                                interesting as a “best-case” scenario, with a short lockdown, equitable school funding,
                                and world-leading rates of
                                broadband access. Despite favorable conditions, we find that students made little or no
                                progress while learning from
                                home. Learning loss was most pronounced among students from disadvantaged homes.</p>

                            <p>Is the American public more likely to favor stricter gun legislation in the aftermath of
                                deadly mass shootings? The
                                authors leverage the occurrence of several mass shootings during multiple survey waves
                                of the General Social Survey
                                between 1987 and 2018 to examine whether exposure to a mass shooting sways public
                                opinion on gun legislation. The
                                results reveal that mass shootings increase support for stricter gun permits among
                                Democrats but not for individuals of
                                other political orientations. An exception to this finding occurs with school shootings,
                                which mobilize broad support
                                for firearm legislation among both Democrats and Republicans.</p>

                            <p>Who goes to protests? To answer this question, existing research has relied either on
                                retrospective surveys of
                                populations or in-protest surveys of participants. Both techniques are prohibitively
                                costly and face logistical and
                                methodological constraints. In this article, we investigate the possibility of surveying
                                protests using Twitter. We
                                propose two techniques for sampling protestors on the ground from digital traces and
                                estimate the demographic and
                                ideological composition of ten protestor crowds using multidimensional scaling and
                                machine-learning techniques. We test
                                the accuracy of our estimates by comparing to two in-protest surveys from the 2017
                                Women’s March in Washington, D.C.
                                Results show that our Twitter sampling techniques are superior to hashtag sampling
                                alone. They also approximate the
                                ideology and gender distributions derived from on-the-ground surveys, albeit with some
                                bias, but fail to retrieve
                                accurate age group estimates. We conclude that online samples are yet unable to provide
                                reliable representative samples
                                of offline protest.</p>

                            <p>There is growing academic interest in examining how terrorist attacks shape the
                                majority’s attitudes towards minority
                                groups. Yet, little is known of how these minority groups react to the backlash such
                                events provoke. This paper
                                leverages the exogenous occurrence of a series of terrorist attacks during the fieldwork
                                period of two surveys to
                                estimate how such events affect the sentiment of both citizens and asylum seekers in
                                Germany. Results of the natural
                                experiment reveal that the 2016 terror attacks in Nice, Würzburg, and Ansbach
                                substantially increased anti-refugee
                                sentiment among German respondents. In line with this increase in hostility, refugees
                                experienced more discrimination,
                                felt less welcome in Germany, and suffered clinically relevant declines in mental health
                                in the aftermath of the
                                attacks. These results provide a more holistic understanding of how terrorism corrodes
                                intergroup relations and how it
                                affects those that are blamed for the events and thus suffer the brunt of the backlash
                                following their occurrence.</p>

                            <p>In this article, I study the role that threatening events play in shaping both the
                                occurrence
                                and the distribution of
                                intergroup conflict. Using the case of anti-refugee attacks in Germany, the study finds
                                that
                                the 2015 New Year’s Eve
                                (NYE) sexual assaults led to a dramatic surge in the daily rate of violence, far
                                surpassing
                                the more short-lived effect
                                of domestic and European terrorist attacks. Importantly, this effect was more pronounced
                                among districts with low prior
                                levels of anti-refugee hostility and far-right support. The NYE event both increased the
                                frequency and changed the
                                distribution of subsequent attacks—mobilizing new, previously peaceful communities to
                                behave
                                aggressively towards local
                                refugee populations. Together, these findings reveal that threatening events not only
                                affect
                                the amount of intergroup
                                conflict, but may also alter the structural conditions under which such conflict emerges
                                in
                                the first place.</p>
