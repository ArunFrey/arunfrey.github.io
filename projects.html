                                <h5>Ongoing project (w. M Verhagen and A Tilstra) </h5>

                            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to severe reductions in non-COVID related healthcare use. 
                                This study investigates whether the reduction in administered care disproportionately 
                                affected marginalised population groups. 
                                Using detailed medical claims data from the Dutch universal health care system that covers all residents in The Netherlands, we predict expected healthcare use based on 
                                pre-pandemic trends and compare these expectations with observed healthcare use in 2020.
                                Our findings reveal a substantial 10% decline in the number of treated patients in 2020 relative to prior years.
                                Declines more pronounced for individuals below the poverty line, females, the elderly, and foreign-born individuals.
                                These inequalities stem predominantly from declines in middle and low urgency procedures, and indicate that the pandemic 
                                has not only had an unequal toll in terms of the direct health burden of the pandemic, but has also had a differential impact on the use of non-COVID healthcare.

                            <p>We are partnering with Allegheny County Department of Human Services to better allocate rental assistance to
                            high risk individuals in order to keep them from falling into homelessness. Our project consists of
                            two interconnected goals: (1) to more efficiently allocate rental assistance by prioritizing those at highest risk of entering
                            into homelessness, and (2) to do so in a manner that is equitable. 
                            Our model is trained on rich historical data and predicts whether an individual 
                            who is currently facing an eviction is at risk of falling into homelessness in the near future, 
                            to prioritise them for rental assistance.
                            Initial comparisons suggest that this system constitutes a considerable improvement on the county's current decision-making process, ensuring both a more efficient and an equitable resource allocation.
                            The efficacy of this system is currently being tested in a field trial.

                            <p>The opening of refugee shelters is regularly met with protest from the surrounding
                                community, in part
                                because residents
                                fear that the presence of nearby shelters may devalue the local neighbourhood.
                                In this project I use data on indivdiual property listings across various cities as well as
                                information on the time and place of refugee shelter openings to assess whether the opening
                                of a new shelter affects the desirability of the surrounding area.
