I teach applied statistics to undergraduate students at the [_Oxford Q-Step Centre_](https://www.oqc.ox.ac.uk/graduate-teaching-assistant/arun-frey.html), and am a TA for Prof. David Kirk's graduate course on _Applied Statistics for Social Scientists_. I occassionally give tutorial on _Political Sociology_ and _Social Movements_ and [introductory courses](https://github.com/ArunFrey/intro-to-R) on how to code in `R`. This past year I have been teaching a seminar on how to use Twitter data for academic research at the [_Oxford Spring School in Advanced Research Methods_](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/spring-school/oxford-spring-school-in-advanced-research-methods.html).
