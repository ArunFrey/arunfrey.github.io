I am a Post-Doctoral Researcher with the [Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science](https://www.demographicscience.ox.ac.uk), and a member of the Sociology department at the [University of Oxford](https://www.sociology.ox.ac.uk/people/arun-frey.html). My research has been featured in various news outlets, including the _New York Times_, _The Economist_, *Die Zeit*, *ARTE*, and the *BBC*. 


In my work I use computational methods to contribute to the areas of violence, migration, and inequality.

My doctoral research examines the conditions under which immigration mobilizes opposition---particularly outside the political arena---and what such opposition entails for marginalized communities. A chapter of my PhD thesis has recently been published at the [European Sociological Review](https://academic.oup.com/esr/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/esr/jcaa007/5814862). 

I also study how school closures during COVID-19 have impacted student learning and educational inequality. This research was recently published at the [Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/17/e2022376118) and has had a documented impact on policy in several countries and invited hearings at the European Commission, the OECD, and the World Bank.
